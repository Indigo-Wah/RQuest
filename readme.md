# RQuest

RQuest is a complex ecconomy bot built for 
[Revolt](https://revolt.chat) using [Revolt.py](https://github.com/revoltchat/revolt.py).

## Stateful Ecconomy

Yes, a federated stateful economy. That syncs to all servers the bot is added to. And for those who self host, an option to sync to the federated database. 

Users can contribute to the economy by working on tasks, jobs, or by starting their own businesses. 

And can spend their newly earned money on items, housing, and so much more.

## Tasks / Jobs

Tasks are the most basic form of work. They are simple, and can be completed by anyone. These are essentially little minigames that are done in Revolt by the user.

Jobs are more complex. They require not only being hired, but also for you to maintain your status as a worker by checking in daily and completing tasks relevant to your job. 

## Businesses

Want to start your own company and hire workers? Why not! You can sell in demand items and have your workers collected said items. People will pay for them and you can even use this process to create even better, higher quality items. For example, milling wheat into flour, baking flour into bread, and so much more.

## Items

With a good way to earn, you need a good way to spend. Items are grouped into classes; Functional, Consumable, and Social. 

Functional items are things that speed up working, allow you to work faster and better. Earning you more in the long run. 

Consumable items are one time or two time items that can apply some effect to you. Eating for example might make you stronger and give you a temporary buff.

Social items, these are items that exist to flaunt your status. Fancy house, Fancy car? Money brings you power in RQuest, get alot of it, and find yourself in the spotlight.
